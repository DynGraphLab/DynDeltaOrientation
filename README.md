# delta-orientations
This is repository implements and benchmarks state-of-the-art and new approaches to the problems of finding delta-orientations for sparse graphs.
This is joint work between Jannick Borowitz, Ernestine Gro√ümann, and Christian Schulz.

# Example run

First unpack the example network: 

```console
cd examples
tar xfz *.tar.gz
```
Then run

```console
$ ./deploy/delta-orientations examples/youtube-u-growth.seq --algorithm=NAIVE
io took 4.60033
time 		 0.922766
maxOutDegree 	 118
```

```console
./deploy/delta-orientations examples/youtube-u-growth.seq --algorithm=MAXDECENDING --depth=10
io took 4.48079
time 		 4.0129
internal max deg 78
maxOutDegree 	 78
```

```console
./deploy/delta-orientations examples/youtube-u-growth.seq --algorithm=KFLIPS --flips=10
io took 4.41465
time 		 9.14307
internal max deg 82
maxOutDegree 	 82
```
